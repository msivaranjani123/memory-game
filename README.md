This is a simple Memory Card Matching Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game includes three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) and tracks the score, time, and attempts.
Players flip cards to find matching pairs, and the game ends when all pairs are matched.The game starts when the "Start Game" button is clicked, shuffling the cards and starting a timer. 
When all pairs are matched, a "You Won!" message is displayed on the screen. The logic includes event listeners for card flips, match checking, and resetting the game.
